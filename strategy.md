# Ty Real Estate: Full-Service Agency Strategy
## C41 Cinema's First Full-Service Client

**Agent:** Ty (@ty_the_real_estate_guy)
**Market:** Prescott & Prescott Valley, Arizona
**Builder Partnerships:** Capstone Homes + ĒCCO Homes
**Agency:** C41 Cinema (full-service: web, content, design, marketing)

---

## The Big Picture

Ty is positioned as the go-to agent for new construction in the Prescott area through his builder partnerships, but he also sells resale homes and can help sellers. The strategy has one core goal: **capture emails and generate leads**. Everything we build funnels toward that.

## 1. Website Architecture

### Main Site Structure
One website, multiple pages, 5-10 domains all pointing to it.

**Core Pages:**
- **Homepage** (funnel landing page, already built)
- **About Ty** (personal brand, story, credentials)
- **About Prescott** (relocation guide, lifestyle, why move here)

**Community Pages (one per community):**
- Granite Dells Estates (Capstone)
- Hidden Hills (Capstone)
- Jasper 3B (Capstone)
- Jasper 7 (ĒCCO)
- Jasper 8 (Capstone)
- Skyview (ĒCCO)
- *Add new communities as builders launch them*

Each community page includes: photos, floor plans, pricing, amenities, neighborhood info, and a lead capture form specific to that community.

**Lead Magnet Pages:**
- "Free Prescott Relocation Guide" (PDF download, captures email)
- "Prescott Area Map & Neighborhood Guide" (interactive or PDF, captures email)
- "New Construction Buyer's Guide: What to Know Before You Build" (PDF, captures email)
- "Home Valuation Tool" (for sellers, captures email + property info)
- "Prescott Home Finder Quiz" (RigScout repurpose, captures email, see below)

**Seller Page:**
- "Sell Your Home" page targeting people who need to sell before buying new construction
- Positions Ty as the bridge: sell your current home AND find your new one
- Lead capture: "Get Your Free Home Valuation"

### Domain Strategy (5-10 URLs)
All route to the same site, different landing pages:

| Domain | Routes To | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| tyrealestate.com (or similar) | Homepage | Main brand |
| prescottnewhomes.com | Communities overview | SEO for "Prescott new homes" |
| prescotthomefinder.com | Quiz tool | Lead gen |
| capstonehomesprescott.com | Capstone communities | Builder-specific leads |
| eccohomesprescott.com | ĒCCO communities | Builder-specific leads |
| movingtorescott.com | Relocation guide | Relocation audience |
| prescotthomevaluation.com | Seller page | Seller leads |
| prescottluxuryhomes.com | Granite Dells / Hidden Hills | Luxury buyer leads |

*Check availability and grab what makes sense. Don't need all of these.*

## 2. Lead Capture System

### The Goal: Get the Email

Every page has at least one email capture mechanism:

**Capture Methods:**
1. **Contact form** (consultation request, already built)
2. **Lead magnet downloads** (guides, maps, requires email)
3. **Home Finder Quiz** (RigScout repurpose, email at end for results)
4. **Home valuation tool** (seller leads)
5. **Community-specific inquiry forms** (pre-filled with community name)
6. **Newsletter signup** ("Get weekly Prescott market updates")
7. **Pop-up/slide-in** (triggered on exit intent or scroll depth)

### Email Collection Tool
Options for collecting and managing emails:

**Option A: Lasso CRM Integration**
- Lasso is built for real estate, handles lead routing, drip campaigns
- Need to research their API/webhook options
- Forms can POST to Lasso's lead intake endpoint
- May require Ty's brokerage to set this up

**Option B: If Lasso doesn't work**
- **Follow Up Boss** (popular real estate CRM, good API)
- **Mailchimp/ConvertKit** for email sequences + **Google Sheets** for lead tracking
- **FormSubmit.co** (current setup) + Zapier to push to CRM
- **HubSpot Free CRM** (solid free tier, forms, email sequences)

**Recommendation:** Start with FormSubmit.co + a simple system (even Google Sheets). Once Ty is licensed and has Lasso access through his brokerage, migrate. Don't let CRM setup delay launch.

### Automated Email Sequences

**New Lead Welcome Sequence (5 emails over 2 weeks):**
1. Day 0: "Thanks for reaching out! Here's what to expect" + Prescott overview
2. Day 2: "3 things most people don't know about buying in Prescott"
3. Day 5: "Community spotlight" (feature one community with photos)
4. Day 9: "What the new construction process actually looks like" (positions Ty as expert)
5. Day 14: "Ready to take the next step?" (soft CTA to schedule a call)

**Monthly Newsletter:**
- Prescott market update (median prices, inventory, trends)
- New community announcements
- Featured listings
- Local events and lifestyle content
- Always include a CTA

---

## 3. Home Finder Quiz (RigScout Repurpose)

Take the RigScout quiz framework and rebuild it for real estate:

**"Find Your Perfect Prescott Home"**

**Questions (8-10):**
1. What brings you to Prescott? (Retirement / Remote work / Family / Investment / Second home)
2. What's your budget range? ($400K-500K / $500K-700K / $700K-900K / $900K-1.2M / $1.2M+)
3. How many bedrooms do you need? (2 / 3 / 4 / 5+)
4. Do you need RV or extra garage space? (Yes / No / Nice to have)
5. What matters most? (Views / Amenities / Privacy / Community / Proximity to town)
6. New construction or existing home? (New / Existing / Either)
7. How soon are you looking to move? (ASAP / 3-6 months / 6-12 months / Just exploring)
8. Do you have a home to sell first? (Yes / No)

**Results:**
- Matches them to 1-3 communities based on answers
- Shows pricing, photos, key features
- **Requires email to see full results** (the lead capture moment)
- Offers "Schedule a tour of [matched community]" CTA
- If they need to sell: flags that Ty can help with both sides

**Technical:** Same single-page approach as RigScout, can be a page on the main site or standalone on prescotthomefinder.com.

## 4. Social Media Strategy

### Platform Priority
1. **YouTube** (long-form authority, SEO value)
2. **Instagram Reels** (short-form, engagement)
3. **TikTok** (short-form, reach new audiences)
4. **Facebook** (older demographic, Prescott community groups)

### Content Calendar

**Posting Schedule:**
| Platform | Frequency | Content Type |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Instagram Reels | 1-2x/day | Short-form (30-90 sec) |
| TikTok | 1-2x/day | Same content, cross-posted |
| YouTube Shorts | 1-2x/day | Same content, cross-posted |
| Facebook Reels | 1x/day | Same content, cross-posted |
| Instagram Stories | 3-5x/day | Behind the scenes, polls, Q&A |
| YouTube Long-form | 1-2x/month | Community deep dives, "Moving to Prescott" guides (bonus, not core) |

**That's 7-14 short-form videos per week, same video across all platforms.**
One shoot session = multiple clips. Batch filming days are key.

**Cross-posting tool:** Use Later, Buffer, or Repurpose.io to auto-distribute one video to all platforms simultaneously. C41 handles all posting.

### Content Pillars (Rotate Through These)

**1. Home Tours (40% of content)**
- Walk-throughs of model homes in each community
- Quick move-in home showcases
- "Tour this $500K home in Prescott" format
- Before/during/after construction tours

**2. Prescott Lifestyle (25% of content)**
- "Day in the life in Prescott"
- Best restaurants, hikes, activities
- Seasonal content (fall colors, mild winters vs Phoenix heat)
- Community events
- "Things to do in Prescott this weekend"

**3. Market Education (20% of content)**
- Monthly market updates (30-60 sec summary)
- "What does $500K get you in Prescott?"
- New construction vs resale pros/cons
- "5 things to know before buying in Prescott"
- Interest rate updates and what they mean locally

**4. Personal Brand (15% of content)**
- Ty's relocation story (Utah to Prescott)
- Client success stories / testimonials
- Behind the scenes of the agent life
- Building relationships with the builders
- "Why I chose Prescott"

### Short-Form Content Ideas (Endless Supply)

**Home Tours (film once, cut into 3-5 clips each):**
- "POV: Walking into a $500K home in Prescott"
- "This kitchen though..." (single room highlights)
- "3 things I love about this floor plan"
- Quick walk-through with text overlays showing price/beds/baths

**Prescott Lifestyle (film while living life):**
- "Morning coffee with this view"
- "Things to do in Prescott this weekend"
- "Why everyone is moving to Prescott"
- Restaurant reviews, hike clips, sunset shots
- "Prescott vs [other city]" comparison hooks

**Education / Authority (talking head, 30-60 sec):**
- "One thing most people get wrong about buying new construction"
- "The question I get asked the most"
- "What $X gets you in Prescott" (do this at every price point)
- Market updates in 30 seconds
- "New construction tip of the day"

**Engagement Bait:**
- "Would you live here? Yes or no" (show a home)
- "Guess the price" (always works)
- "Which kitchen do you prefer? A or B"
- "Rate this view 1-10"

### YouTube Long-Form (Bonus, 1-2x/month)
Not the core focus but still valuable for SEO. These rank forever:
- "Moving to Prescott Arizona? Watch This First"
- "Prescott vs Prescott Valley: Which Is Better?"
- "Full Tour: [Community Name]"
- "Cost of Living in Prescott Arizona 2026"

### Content Workflow

1. **Ty films on his phone** (always vertical, always 9:16)
2. **Sends raw footage to C41** (Google Drive, Dropbox, or AirDrop)
3. **C41 edits: captions, graphics, trending audio, text overlays, hook optimization**
4. **C41 posts to ALL platforms simultaneously** (Repurpose.io or Later)
5. **C41 writes captions, hashtags, descriptions for each platform**
6. **Ty engages with comments** (personal touch matters in real estate)

**Turnaround:** Same day or next day. At this volume, batch editing is essential.

**Batch filming strategy:**
- Ty dedicates 2-3 hours, twice a week to filming
- One session at a community = 5-10 clips (different rooms, angles, talking points)
- One lifestyle session per week = 3-5 clips (restaurants, views, activities)
- That's 15-20 clips per week from maybe 5-6 hours of filming total
- C41 edits and schedules them out across the week

**The math:** 1-2 posts/day x 7 days = 7-14 clips/week. Two filming sessions covers that easily.

### Hashtag Strategy
Primary: #PrescottAZ #PrescottRealEstate #PrescottHomes #ArizonaRealEstate #NewConstructionHomes
Community-specific: #JasperPrescott #GraniteDelEstates #CapstoneHomes #ECCOHomes
Lifestyle: #PrescottLife #MovingToArizona #ArizonaLiving #MountainLiving

---

## 5. Physical Marketing / Design

*Note: Door hangers, direct mail, open house materials, and business cards are likely already covered by the builders. Worth confirming with Ty. If they need it, C41 can design these as add-ons for the pitch.*

### Tesla Model 3 Wrap
**Design elements:**
- Ty's name and brand prominently displayed
- Phone number (large, readable at a distance)
- Website URL
- Instagram handle
- "Your Prescott Home Expert" or similar tagline
- Builder logos if permitted (Capstone + ĒCCO)
- Clean, professional, not cluttered
- Color scheme matching the website (warm, inviting)
- Partial wrap recommended (hood, rear, sides) vs full wrap for cost savings

### Waving Arm Inflatable (Air Dancer)
**Design:**
- Ty's branding + community name
- "Now Selling" or "Model Homes Open"
- Phone number
- Website URL
- Placed at community entrances during open houses

### A-Frame Signs (3-4 designs)
**Design 1: Open House**
- "OPEN HOUSE" large text
- Ty's name + photo
- Phone number
- Arrow directional

**Design 2: New Homes**
- "NEW HOMES from $459,900"
- Community name
- Ty's contact info
- QR code to website

**Design 3: Seller-Focused**
- "Thinking of Selling?"
- "Free Home Valuation"
- QR code to valuation page
- Ty's contact info

**Design 4: Generic Brand**
- Ty Real Estate branding
- Multiple use (directional, informational)

## 6. Paid Advertising (Phase 2)

## 8. Timeline / Phases (AGGRESSIVE)

The goal: Ty shows up so loudly and so fast that the other agents at the brokerage can't ignore it. By the time they realize what happened, he's already the face of Prescott real estate online.

### Phase 1: Pre-License Blitz (NOW, weeks 1-2)
Everything that doesn't require a license, do it NOW.

- [x] Website v1 built and live
- [ ] Expand website: individual community pages, seller page
- [ ] Build Home Finder Quiz (RigScout repurpose)
- [ ] Create 3 lead magnet PDFs (relocation guide, area map, buyer's guide)
- [ ] Set up email capture + automated welcome sequence
- [ ] Design Tesla wrap (ready to install day he's licensed)
- [ ] Design A-frame signs + waving arm inflatable
- [ ] Set up YouTube, TikTok, optimize Instagram
- [ ] Claim Google Business Profile (can set up before license)
- [ ] Install retargeting pixels (Facebook + Google) on website
- [ ] **START FILMING CONTENT NOW** (Prescott lifestyle, area tours, "I'm moving to Prescott" series)
- [ ] Build up a content backlog of 20-30 clips before license day
- [ ] Secure domains and set up routing
- [ ] Design email templates (welcome series, newsletter)

### Phase 2: License Day = Launch Day (Week 3-4)
The day he passes his test, EVERYTHING goes live at once. Not a slow rollout. A flood.

- [ ] Flip the switch: start posting 1-2x/day across all platforms
- [ ] Release content backlog (staggered, so it looks like he's everywhere)
- [ ] Install Tesla wrap
- [ ] Deploy A-frame signs at every community
- [ ] Activate community pages with real MLS data
- [ ] Set up Zillow/Realtor.com/Homes.com profiles
- [ ] Begin email drip sequences for any leads already captured
- [ ] Launch Home Finder Quiz with social promo
- [ ] Share lead magnets across social
- [ ] Post in every Prescott Facebook group (tastefully)
- [ ] Google Business Profile goes live with photos, posts
- [ ] First YouTube long-form: "I'm the new agent for Capstone and ĒCCO in Prescott" intro video

### Phase 3: Accelerate (Weeks 4-8)
Don't slow down. The other agents are still wondering what happened.

- [ ] Start paid ads: Facebook lead gen ($500-1K/month)
- [ ] Google Search ads for "homes for sale Prescott AZ" ($500/month)
- [ ] Retargeting ads hitting every website visitor
- [ ] First monthly market report (email + social carousel)
- [ ] Optimize content based on what's getting views/engagement
- [ ] Double down on whatever content is working
- [ ] Start getting Google reviews from first clients/connections
- [ ] Virtual tours of model homes on website
- [ ] **Goal: 200+ email leads by end of month 2**

### Phase 4: Own It (Weeks 8-16)
By now Ty should be the most visible agent in Prescott online. Period.

- [ ] Scale ad spend on proven campaigns
- [ ] Launch referral program
- [ ] Build mortgage lender / inspector / title company partnerships (cross-referrals)
- [ ] Sponsor a local event or two
- [ ] Monthly content review: what's converting, what's not
- [ ] Start a "Prescott Insider" email list (weekly, builds authority)
- [ ] Expand to new communities as builders launch
- [ ] **Goal: First closings from digital leads, 500+ emails, 5K+ social following**

### Phase 5: Undeniable (Months 4-6)
The other agents are now asking how he does it. That's the proof.

- [ ] Ty is the default "Prescott real estate" result on YouTube/TikTok/Google
- [ ] 1,000+ email leads
- [ ] Consistent closings from online channels
- [ ] Partners/other agents come to him asking for advice
- [ ] Builders see the value and give him priority on best lots/inventory
- [ ] **This is where the "I told you so" moment happens**

## What We're NOT Doing (Scope Boundaries)

- We are NOT managing his CRM day-to-day (he handles follow-ups)
- We are NOT running his open houses (he does that)
- We are NOT his transaction coordinator
- We ARE his marketing team: web, content, design, strategy, posting
- We ARE building the systems that generate and capture leads
- He films, we produce. He closes, we generate.
